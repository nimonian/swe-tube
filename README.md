The purpose of this project is to discover, through building it, a set of best practices for the tech stack we deliver in our core curriculum.

There are two main benefits of having this set of best practices:
 - we can be consistent - it is confusing for learners when resources *accidentally* contradict one another
 - we have a clearer picture of the outcomes we want for our learners, and we can concert our efforts in leading learners to those outcomes

## What does it do?

"StumbleUpon for SWE Apprentices"

All learners search the internet for learning resources. On SWE Tube users can post their favourite finds for others to discover and discuss.
